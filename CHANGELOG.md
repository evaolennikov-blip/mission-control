## [1.4.2] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed
- **Session–task linking** — Dispatch now sets `task_id` on the OpenClaw session record (both new and reused sessions). Fixes orphaned session cleanup and enables per-task session tracking.
- **False stall detection** — Reconciler now checks for an active OpenClaw session linked to the task before flagging it as stalled. Previously, agents actively coding but not logging intermediate progress were incorrectly re-dispatched after 30 minutes.

---

## [1.4.1] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- **Reconciler Loop** — Background reconciliation loop (`src/lib/reconciler.ts`) runs every 30 seconds to retry failed dispatches, detect stalled tasks, clean up orphaned OpenClaw sessions, and drain queued tasks. Inspired by Symphony's poll-and-reconcile pattern.
- **WORKFLOW.md Config** — File-based workflow configuration with YAML front matter and hot-reload (`src/lib/workflow-loader.ts`). Define stages, roles, fail targets, reconciler settings, and concurrency limits in a single versioned file. Falls back to DB-stored templates when no file exists.
- **Atomic Dispatch** — `dispatch_lock` column on tasks provides check-and-set mutual exclusion, preventing double-dispatch race conditions. Agent assignment + activity logging wrapped in SQLite transactions.
- **Retry with Exponential Backoff** — Failed dispatches auto-schedule retries via `retry_count` and `next_retry_at` columns. Backoff: 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s, 160s (capped at 5 min). Max 5 retries before permanent error.
- **Bounded Concurrency** — `max_concurrent_tasks` setting (default 3, configurable in WORKFLOW.md) limits how many tasks can be dispatched simultaneously per workspace. Excess tasks wait until a slot opens.
- **Migration 014** — Adds `retry_count`, `next_retry_at`, and `dispatch_lock` columns to the tasks table.

### Changed
- **Validation limits** — Task description max raised from 10,000 to 50,000 characters.
- **Workflow resolution order** — `getTaskWorkflow()` now checks: task-specific template → WORKFLOW.md file → workspace default → global default.
- **Dispatch error handling** — All dispatch error paths (workflow engine + PATCH route) now use `scheduleRetry()` instead of bare error recording.

### Fixed
- **drainQueue() TOCTOU** — Fixed time-of-check/time-of-use race in queue draining with optimistic lock (`UPDATE WHERE status = ?`).
- **handleStageFailure() race** — Status update now uses optimistic lock and resets retry state atomically.
- **Circular dependency crash** — Reconciler startup caused `c.zf is not a function` in minified production build due to `db/index.ts → reconciler.ts → @/lib/db` import cycle. Fixed by starting reconciler from SSE stream route.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- **Multi-Agent Workflow Pipeline** — Full task lifecycle now supports staged orchestration: `planning → inbox → assigned → in_progress → testing → review → verification → done`.
- **Core Agent Bootstrap** — New workspaces can auto-bootstrap a 4-agent core team: Builder (🛠️), Tester (🧪), Reviewer (🔍), and Learner (📚).
- **Workflow Engine Coordination** — Added queue-aware review draining (`drainQueue()`), automatic role-based stage handoffs, and fail-loopback routing.
- **Learner Knowledge Loop** — Learner notifications on stage transitions plus knowledge injection into future dispatch messages.
- **New API Routes**
  - `POST /api/tasks/[id]/fail`
  - `GET /api/tasks/[id]/roles`
  - `POST /api/workspaces/[id]/knowledge`
  - `GET /api/workspaces/[id]/workflows`

### Changed
- **Strict template defaults** — Strict workflow is now default, with review as queue stage and verification owned by the `reviewer` role.
- **Workspace initialization** — New workspaces can clone workflow templates and bootstrap core agents automatically.
- **Project branding/docs** — Updated project branding to Autensa (formerly Mission Control) and added explicit privacy-first statement in docs.

### Fixed
- **Role mismatch** — Fixed strict template verification role (`verifier` → `reviewer`).
- **Review queue bypass** — Fixed auto-advance behavior that could skip proper review queue flow.
- **Dispatch status transition** — Fixed dispatch route using hardcoded `done`; now uses computed next workflow status.
- **Assigned-status resolution** — Fixed mapping so `assigned` resolves to builder stage dispatch correctly.
- **Task template assignment** — Fixed task creation path so default workflow template is attached automatically.
- **Learner role assignment** — Fixed missing `task_roles` learner assignment so the learner receives transition events.

### Migration
- **Migration 013: Fresh Start** — Resets runtime task/agent/event data, sets Strict as default workflow template, and bootstraps core agents for the default workspace.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- **Agent Activity Dashboard** — Dedicated page for monitoring agent work with mobile card layout. (#48 — thanks @pkgaiassistant-droid!)
- **Remote Model Discovery** — Discover AI models from OpenClaw Gateway via `MODEL_DISCOVERY=true` env var. (#43 — thanks @davetha!)
- **Proxy Troubleshooting** — Added docs for users behind HTTP proxies experiencing 502 errors on agent callbacks.

### Fixed
- **Force-Dynamic API Routes** — All API routes now use `force-dynamic` to prevent stale cached responses. (#43)
- **Null Agent Assignment** — `assigned_agent_id` can now be null in task creation schema. (#38 — thanks @JamesCao2048!)
- **Dispatch Spec Forwarding** — Planning spec and agent instructions now forwarded in dispatch messages. (#51)
- **Dispatch Failure Recovery** — Tasks stuck in `pending_dispatch` auto-reset to planning status. (#52)

---

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- **Gateway Agent Discovery** — Import existing agents from your OpenClaw Gateway into Mission Control. New "Import from Gateway" button in the agent sidebar opens a discovery modal that lists all Gateway agents, shows which are already imported, and lets you bulk-import with one click. Imported agents display a `GW` badge for provenance tracking. ([#22](https://github.com/crshdn/mission-control/issues/22) — thanks [@markphelps](https://github.com/markphelps)!)
- **Docker Support** — Production-ready multi-stage Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml with persistent volumes, and `.dockerignore`. Runs as non-root, uses `dumb-init` for signal handling, includes health checks. ([#21](https://github.com/crshdn/mission-control/pull/21) — thanks [@muneale](https://github.com/muneale)!)
- **Agent Protocol Conventions** — Added `PROGRESS_UPDATE` and `BLOCKED` message formats to the Agent Protocol docs to prevent agent stalling. ([#24](https://github.com/crshdn/mission-control/pull/24) — thanks [@nice-and-precise](https://github.com/nice-and-precise)!)

### Fixed

- **Planning Flow Improvements** — Refactored polling to prevent stale state issues, fixed "Other" free-text option (case mismatch bug), made `due_date` nullable, increased planning timeout to 90s for larger models, auto-start polling on page load. ([#26](https://github.com/crshdn/mission-control/pull/26) — thanks [@JamesTsetsekas](https://github.com/JamesTsetsekas)!)
- **WebSocket RPC Deduplication Bug** — The event deduplication cache was silently dropping repeated RPC responses with the same payload hash, causing request timeouts. RPC responses now bypass dedup entirely.
- **Next.js Response Caching** — Dynamic API routes that query live state (e.g., agent discovery) now use `force-dynamic` to prevent stale cached responses.

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-16

### 🔒 Security

- **API Authentication Middleware** — Bearer token authentication for all API routes. Set `MC_API_TOKEN` in `.env.local` to enable. Same-origin browser requests are automatically allowed.
- **Webhook HMAC-SHA256 Validation** — Agent completion webhooks now require a valid `X-Webhook-Signature` header. Set `WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env.local` to enable.
- **Path Traversal Protection** — File download endpoint now uses `realpathSync` to resolve symlinks and validate all paths are within the allowed directory.
- **Error Message Sanitization** — API error responses no longer leak internal details (stack traces, file paths) in production.
- **Security Headers** — Added `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, and `Permissions-Policy` headers via Next.js config.
- **Input Validation (Zod)** — Request payloads for tasks, agents, and workspaces are validated with Zod schemas before processing.
- **Repository Audit** — Purged sensitive files from git history, updated `.gitignore` to block database files and backups.

### Added

- **Ed25519 Device Identity** — Gateway pairing now uses Ed25519 key-based device identity for secure handshakes.
- **ARIA Hook** — Real-time agent tracking bridge between ARIA and Mission Control (`scripts/aria-mc-hook.sh`).
- **Planning Poll Endpoint** — New `POST /api/tasks/[id]/planning/poll` for long-poll planning updates.
- **Retry Dispatch** — New `POST /api/tasks/[id]/planning/retry-dispatch` to retry failed task dispatches.
- **Auto-Dispatch Module** — `src/lib/auto-dispatch.ts` for automatic task assignment after planning.
- **Planning Utilities** — `src/lib/planning-utils.ts` with shared planning logic.
- **MC Bridge Scripts** — Python and shell bridge scripts for external integrations.

### Changed

- **Node.js v25 Support** — Updated `better-sqlite3` to v12.6.2 for Node v25 compatibility.
- **Default Port** — Mission Control now defaults to port 4000 (previously 3000).
- **Improved Planning Tab** — Enhanced UI with better question rendering, progress tracking, and error handling.
- **Agent Sidebar Improvements** — Better status display, model selection, and agent management.
- **Activity Log Overhaul** — Cleaner timeline UI with better type icons and formatting.
- **Live Feed Improvements** — Better real-time event display with filtering options.
